# Pokemon List

This is a web application that displays a list of Pokemon using PokeAPI, written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Preview of the website: [Pokemon List](https://martin-pokemon-list-react.vercel.app/)

## Running the application

Run th

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Pages can be edited by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates the file is edited.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
